    Presence: Powershell ShortHand Syntax

   Powershell has short-hand syntax for its language to ease the use.
   A short-hand is different than a powershell `alias`.

   A short-hand can be identified as:
       -iex    shorthand for the commandlet Invoke-Expresion

   Therefore, by hunting for commandline usage, we can save ourselves work and explore how
   that language is being used, and possibly if present, where it occurred.

       We:
           - Focus our hunt on the parameters
