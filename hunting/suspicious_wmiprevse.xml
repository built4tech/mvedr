The WMI Provider Host process is an important part of Windows, and often runs in the background. 
It allows other applications on your computer to request information about your system. 
This process shouldnâ€™t normally use many system resources, but it may use a lot of CPU if another process on your system is 
behaving badly.
    
The following query shows the processese executed by wmiprvse.exe parent process. To test it execute from cli 
wmic process call create notepad.exe, it should open a process notepad being its parent wmiprvse.exe

To test this rule execute wmic process call create notepad.exe, this line should open the notepad application being the parent process
wmiprvse.exe

HostInfo hostname AND ProcessHistory parentname, name, id, cmdline WHERE ProcessHistory parentname equals "wmiprvse.exe"
