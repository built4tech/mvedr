    Description: 

    Image Path: %SystemRoot%\system32\svchost.exe
    Parent Process: services.exe (most often)
    Number of Instances: Many (generally at least 10)
    User Account: Varies depending on svchost instance, though it typically will be Local System, Network Service, or
    Local Service accounts. Windows 10 also has some instances running as logged-on users.
    Start Time: Typically within seconds of boot time. However, services can be started after boot (e.g., at logon), which
    results in new instances of svchost.exe after boot time.
    Description: Generic host process for Windows services. It is used for running service DLLs. Windows will
    run multiple instances of svchost.exe, each using a unique “-k” parameter for grouping similar services.
    Typical “-k” parameters include DcomLaunch, RPCSS, LocalServiceNetworkRestricted, LocalServiceNoNetwork,
    LocalServiceAndNoImpersonation, netsvcs, NetworkService, and more. Malware authors often take advantage of the
    ubiquitous nature of svchost.exe and use it either to host a malicious DLL as a service, or run a malicious process
    named svchost.exe or similar spelling. Beginning in Windows 10 version 1703, Microsoft changed the default
    grouping of similar services if the system has more than 3.5 GB of RAM. In such cases, most services will run under
    their own instance of svchost.exe. On systems with more than 3.5 GB RAM, expect to see more than 50 instances of
    svchost.exe (the screenshot in the poster is a Windows 10 VM with 3 GB RAM).
    
    SVCHOST should mainly be launched by the designated SERVICES.EXE process in Windows.

    The following query shows those svchost.exe proccesses which parentname is not services.exe

    HostInfo hostname AND ProcessHistory parentname, name, id, cmdline WHERE ProcessHistory parentname not equals "services.exe" 
            AND ProcessHistory name equals "svchost.exe
